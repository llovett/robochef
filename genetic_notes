TODO:
-----
* implement random distribution for selecting parents
* choose type of crossover -> ingredient by ingredient, or cross at a
* certain point
* choose mutation probability
* figure out how to represent individuals

Algorithm:
----------
do:
    -> let C be the empty set
    -> for size_of_population:
        -> choose parents p1 and p2 based on random distribution
        -> c = cross(p1, p2)
        -> with small prob. mutate(c)
        -> add c to C
    -> set P = C
while individual_not_yet_found OR time_is_up
-> return the most fit individual from the current population
